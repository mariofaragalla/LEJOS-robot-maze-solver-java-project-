This project was part of the Design and Implementation of Software Systems 2019 course at TUHH.
The goal of this project was to solve a maze using the Lejos robot. 
The maze had a color only at the corners and the robot's duty was to search for the color 
and when it detects the color it should make a beep.
The color that the robot searches for is given by the user using a simple Menu.
The algorithm implemented for such a task is a simple left-wall follower.
